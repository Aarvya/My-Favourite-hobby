        <p>I love watching T.V and Reading Books . Books have knowledge and T.V has entartainment.One of the oldest forms of knowledge providers are books; therefore, they are also called the powerhouse of knowledge and information. Books provide us information without asking for anything in return, and often it is considered as the best company a human can have.Television was invented by the scientist J.L. Baird. It is the first electronic appliance that can be used to watch movies, videos, TV shows, and much more. Children prefer to view the TV all the time because of the many entertaining cartoons they show us.Television, sometimes shortened to TV or telly, is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black and white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. The term can refer to a television set, a television show, or the medium of television transmission.I have many Disney Princess Books and I have Read all of them I love these both activities and I do them the most (specially watching tv).</p>
